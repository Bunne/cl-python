This directory and cvs module was created from the Python
implementation done by Willem Broekema during the summer of 2004.  As
of this writing the code builds and seems to work, although there will
be a process o0f integrating it with ACL build conventions gradually
over time.

Right now parsepython depends on the version of yacc captured in this
directory:

  yacc-defsys.cl
  yacc-defs.cl
  yacc-compile.cl
  yacc-runtime.cl

These yacc files will be deleted when the yacc in the regular ACL 7.0
distribution is compatible.

First, build yacc by loading the defsys and following the instructions
through the concatenate-system.

 :ld yacc-defsys
 (compile-system :yacc)
 (concatenate-system :yacc "yacc.fasl")


The start a fresh (modern!) lisp:

 :ld package
 :pa :python
 (compy)

This will build and lad python.  (repl) will give a repl, if you can
figure out how to type into it.
