- tuple( [1,2] ) doesn't work (printer error)
- lexer doesn't support imaginary numbers, unicode, new @ syntax
- no metaclasses
- no properties
- generator functions not handled yet
- exceptions must be recast as python exceptions as much as possible (what about tracebacks?)
- lexer should allow newlines inside lists, tuples, dicts
- support   def f((a,b), c): print b
            f((1,2),3) -> "2"
  by introducing `anonymous' variable name for first argument.
